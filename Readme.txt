This release channel is for the Unix Builds!

YES! Unix is supported fully, and the program will get updates as frequently as Windows too!

Although this build is tested on the following OSes, it should support any system running Unix.

Supported OSes:
1. Ubuntu
2. OpenSUSE
3. OSX
4. Debian
5. Deepin OS

If you want to add an OS to this list, you're welcome to test it on a new OS and upload the results!

Cheers!
